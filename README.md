This project attempts to use artificial intelligence to simulate a red-versus-blue computer battle, where red acts as a malicious actor seeking to gain access to or steal files from a blue server. In this simulation, the artificial intelligence would control the actions of the red virtual machine and then also control the blue virtual machine.
